## Title
Sentiment Analysis of Text Reviews

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify text reviews into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The model leverages both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to evaluate the sentiment of user-generated content.

## 1. Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. This project aims to classify text reviews from users into three sentiment categories using various machine learning and deep learning models.

## 2. Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of text reviews labeled with sentiments. Each review is categorized as:
- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral

The dataset should be a CSV file containing at least two columns:
- `cleaned_review`: The processed text of the reviews.
- `Sentiments`: The corresponding sentiment label.

### Example Structure:
| cleaned_review               | Sentiments |
|------------------------------|------------|
| I love this product!         | Positive   |
| This is the worst experience. | Negative   |
| It was okay, nothing special.| Neutral    |

## 3. Requirements
The following libraries are required to run this project:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- keras

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow

# 4. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing the text data for analysis. The following steps are performed:

1. **Loading the Dataset:** The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Mapping Sentiments:** The sentiment labels are mapped to numerical values:
- Positive -> 1
- Negative -> 0
- Neutral -> 2
3. **Handling Missing Values:** NaN values are checked and removed from the dataset.
4. **Text Vectorization:** The text reviews are vectorized using CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

# 5. Model Training
The project implements several traditional machine learning models and deep learning models:

**Traditional Models:**
- SGD Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- AdaBoost
- Support Vector Classifier
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Deep Learning Models:
- Two sequential neural networks using Keras.
Each model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on a separate test dataset.

# Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Precision:** Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Measures the ability to find all relevant instances.
- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC Curve:** A graphical representation of the true positive rate vs. false positive rate.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A table to visualize the performance of the model.
# Results
The results from the model evaluation provide insights into its performance. The confusion matrix and classification report can guide further improvements.

# 6. Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in classifying the sentiments of the text reviews. The accuracy scores for each model are printed after training.

# 7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of both traditional and deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis. The models are capable of classifying user reviews into the specified sentiment categories, providing a foundation for further exploration and refinement.

# 8. Future Work
Future enhancements could include:

Experimenting with more advanced NLP techniques such as BERT or GPT for improved accuracy.
Implementing hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Exploring other text preprocessing techniques such as stemming or lemmatization.
Incorporating additional features from the dataset to improve classification results.
